# Track_bead_On_tube_3D
Using this code you can track the position of an attached bead to a tube in 3D. 
To run this code you need to have a 4D tif stack with two channel (Channel 1 includes the tube signal and 2 includes the bead signal, 
as a sample a test image has been uploaded with the code). 
instruction:
1) run the code in matlab.
2) input image information (slices: number of frames in z, Frame (t): number of stacks, Frame interval (s): 
time interval between stacks). The defult number is for the sample image (test_image).
